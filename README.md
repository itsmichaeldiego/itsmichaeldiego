### Hi, I'm Michael ðŸ‘‹

I am an enthusiastic JS Developer but also a traveler, an ecologist and a dreamer. I really like programming in all senses, but early in my career I started to be more curious about JS, and I love it! I've worked with most of the Technologies available, but the last few years I've been working mostly in the React world. I like to write good quality code that is clean, readable and production-ready.
