### Hey there, I'm Michael! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an enthusiastic JavaScript Developer with a passion for exploring the world, protecting the environment, and nurturing big dreams. While programming has always fascinated me, my journey led me to discover my true passion for JavaScript, and I absolutely love it! Over the years, I've gained experience working with a wide range of technologies, but recently, I've been primarily focused on the exciting world of React.

One of my notable accomplishments is being a co-creator of google-map-react, a project that has allowed me to contribute to the mapping ecosystem. It's been an incredible experience, and I'm always seeking more collaborators to join our efforts!
